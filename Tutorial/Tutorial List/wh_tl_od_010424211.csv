name01#0,"""Chain Attacks"""
text01#0,"""This is an explanation about chain attacks. Chain attacks are a part of an attack system that inflicts great damage on hostiles by landing photon arts or charged techniques after piling on standard attacks.<br><br>A chain starts when an attack scores a hit while the Gunner skill \""Chain Trigger\"" is in effect. Once a chain starts, it will continue to grow if you and your party keep scoring hits within a specific period of time."""
text02#0,"""The chain ends when the player who started the chain scores a hit with a photon art or charged techniques, dealing major damage to the target hostile. Work with other party members to use this skill in defeating powerful hostiles."""
